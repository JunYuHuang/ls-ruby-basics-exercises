# Notes

- misc
  - numbers are immutable
  - strings are mutable
  - (outer) local variables are visible in blocks, procs, and lambdas via closures
  - method scope is self-contained / private
  - block scope is public i.e. can access outer variables
- tricky questions I got wrong
  - `Variable Scope`
    - 10
  - `Loops 1`
    - 3
