# My Solution

The problems are that:

- `input` is a string.
- The `character_classes` hash does not have any string keys.
- The `character_classes` hash does not have a default fallback non-`nil` value should a non-existent key be accessed.
- The `merge` method only accepts 1+ non-`nil` hashes.
- The `merge` call does not update the `player` hash it is called on in-place.

Thus, the original program raises an error no matter what the user inputs because the input is a string key not in `character_classes`.

To fix the problems:

- Ensure `input` is converted to a symbol value.
- Ensure `character_classes` has a fallback value set to an empty hash.
- Swap the `merge` call with a `merge!` call so that the `player` hash can be updated.

Fixed code:

```ruby
# Each player starts with the same basic stats.

player = { strength: 10, dexterity: 10, charisma: 10, stamina: 10 }

# Then the player picks a character class and gets an upgrade accordingly.

character_classes = {
  warrior: { strength:  20 },
  thief:   { dexterity: 20 },
  scout:   { stamina:   20 },
  mage:    { charisma:  20 }
}
character_classes.default = {}

puts 'Please type your class (warrior, thief, scout, mage):'
input = gets.chomp.downcase.to_sym

player.merge!(character_classes[input])

puts 'Your character stats:'
puts player
```
